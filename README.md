# Android-Sample-App

Build a simple app that consumes data from the JSONPlaceholder API. (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
The main screen should show a list of users with their name and username displayed. Each row should also display two buttons, one with the text “photos” and another one with the text “posts”.


When the “Photos” button is tapped, it should navigate to a separate screen that displays the pictures posted by the user.


When the “Posts” button is tapped, it should navigate to a separate screen that displays the posts created by the user as well as the comments to the post.



All screens should have back navigation
Extras:
All screens should have a “Loading” state with a circular progress bar or similar
Ability to delete posts
